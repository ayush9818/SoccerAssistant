# SoccerAssistant

## Introduction

SoccerAssistant is a two-system chatbot we created for the Northwestern men's soccer team. It is designed to enhance performance both on and off the field. The first system focuses on **competitive strategy**, helping coaches and analysts review opponent tactics, assess strengths and weaknesses, and recommend strategies for upcoming matches. The second system is dedicated to **analytics**, providing detailed insights into player and team performance, aiding in **player evaluation** by tracking key metrics, and helping with **team evaluation** to identify areas for improvement. Together, these systems support the teamâ€™s decision-making process, helping the coaching staff make data-driven adjustments to improve both individual and team performance.

## Agentic Workflow

### **Agentic Workflow Overview**

1. **Soccer Assistant Bot**:
   - The system represents a multi-agent architecture designed to process user queries in the context of soccer-related data.
   - It consists of multiple specialized agents, each focused on a specific type of information: 
     - **Team Agent**: Handles team-related information and statistics.
     - **Player Agent**: Focuses on player-specific statistics and performance.
     - **Strategy Agent**: Analyzes game strategies and tactics.
     - **SQL Analytics Agent**: Processes structured data queries using a Text-to-SQL capability.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The user inputs a query into the system.
   - A central **LLM-based Selector** automatically determines which agents are relevant for the query. It intelligently re-routes the query to one or more agents.

3. **Agent Processing**:
   - Each agent processes the query independently based on its domain of expertise.
   - For example:
     - The Player Agent might fetch player statistics.
     - The SQL Analytics Agent might retrieve structured data from a database.
     - The Strategy Agent could analyze tactics or provide insights into game plans.

4. **Response Summarization**:
   - The outputs from all the agents are merged and summarized into a single cohesive response.
   - This ensures that the user receives a comprehensive answer to their query, drawing from all relevant domains.

This workflow ensures efficient and accurate handling of diverse soccer-related queries by leveraging the specialized capabilities of each agent. It uses LLM-driven intelligence for routing and summarization, creating an intelligent, user-friendly system.
