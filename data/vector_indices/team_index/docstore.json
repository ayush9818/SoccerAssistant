However, smart passes were completely unsuccessful, indicating a potential area for tactical refinement.\n\n- **Discipline and Fouls:** The team committed 11 fouls, received 1 yellow card, and no red cards, maintaining a relatively disciplined approach throughout the match.\n\n### Observations and Areas for Improvement:\n\n- **Offensive Efficiency:** Despite limited shots, Wisconsin's ability to convert chances into goals was impressive. However, increasing the volume of shots, especially from outside the box (where they had none), could diversify their attacking threat.\n\n- **Possession and Passing:** With only 32.36% possession and a pass success rate of 66.08%, enhancing ball retention and distribution could help control the game more effectively and create more sustained attacking opportunities.\n\n- **Counterattacks:** The team had 1 counterattack but did not manage to convert it into a shot, suggesting room for improvement in exploiting quick transitions.\n\n- **Set Piece Threat:** With a set piece threat rate of only 3.45%, optimizing set-piece strategies could provide additional scoring opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Wisconsin Badgers showcased a strong defensive performance and clinical finishing to secure their win. While their possession and passing efficiency could be improved, their ability to capitalize on limited chances and maintain defensive solidity was key to their success in this match.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3519, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "420b4814-5080-4b1e-a493-31721d33d21c": {"__data__": {"id_": "420b4814-5080-4b1e-a493-31721d33d21c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"competition": "United States.

Their defensive strength was calculated at 0.2727, which suggests room for improvement in thwarting opposition attacks. However, they excelled in defensive duels, winning 69.23% of them, and air duels, with a success rate of 65.52%.\n\nThey also recorded 26 interceptions and 10 clearances, showcasing their ability to disrupt the opponent's play.
