**Key Insights:**

1. **Defensive Solidity:** Michigan's defense was a highlight, successfully keeping a clean sheet despite facing 13 shots. Their defensive duels win rate of 69.64% and a high number of interceptions (59) were crucial in maintaining this.

2. **Offensive Challenges:** The Wolverines struggled offensively, with all shots taken from outside the box and a mean shot distance of 26.35 meters. This suggests difficulty in penetrating the opponent's defense and creating high-quality chances.

3. **Passing Dynamics:** While Michigan maintained decent possession, their forward passing success rate stood at 56.74%, indicating challenges in advancing the ball effectively into attacking areas.

4. **Set Piece and Counterattack Opportunities:** With a 100% success rate on free-kicks leading to shots, set pieces could be an area to exploit further. However, the lack of counterattacks (0) suggests an opportunity to develop quick transition play.

In conclusion, while the Michigan Wolverines demonstrated defensive resilience, their offensive inefficiencies and passing accuracy need addressing to capitalize on their possession advantage. Improving shot creation and execution, alongside refining set piece strategies, could enhance their overall performance in future matches."

- **Strengths:** Rutgers demonstrated strong aerial ability and maintained a high pass success rate, which is crucial for dictating play and building attacks.
- **Weaknesses:** Despite having more possession, Rutgers struggled to convert this into goals, evident from their low shot efficiency. Their defense could also improve, as they allowed two goals despite facing fewer shots on target.
- **Opportunities for Improvement:** Enhancing shot accuracy and conversion, particularly from set pieces and smart passes, could significantly boost their offensive output. Additionally, bolstering defensive duels could reduce the number of goals conceded.

In summary, while Rutgers displayed commendable control over the ball and showed potential in aerial duels, their inability to capitalize on possession and defensive lapses ultimately led to their defeat against Michigan State. Focusing on these areas could turn future close matches in their favor."
