- **SCHOOL NAME: **Michigan Wolverines:****
  - Strengths:
    - **Balanced Attack:** Their successful mix of central and wide passes allows them flexibility in creating multiple attacking options, which can confuse opposing defenses and open space for attacks.
    - **Long Passing Options:** The ability to quickly switch play through long passes creates mismatches and can exploit weak defensive alignments.
    - **Solid Duels in Midfield:** High success rate in duels, particularly in the central areas, helps them coordinate attacks and regain possession effectively when they lose it.
  - Weaknesses:
    - **Disjointed Attacks:** The diversity in their passing can lead to a lack of cohesion, resulting in wasted opportunities if players are not synchronized.
    - **Transition Vulnerabilities:** A scattergun approach increases risks during transitions, making them vulnerable to counterattacks when they lose possession.
    - **Weakness in Wide Play:** While balanced, their less pronounced wide play can limit their attack options against well-organized defenses.
  - Northwestern's Strategy:
    - **Focus on Midfield Pressing:** Northwestern can disrupt Michigan’s rhythm by applying pressure in central areas, preventing them from forming cohesive attacks or switching effectively.
    - **Exploit the Transition:** By maintaining a compact defensive shape while allowing Michigan to push up the pitch, Northwestern can quickly transition into counterattacks, leveraging Michigan's defensive gaps.
    - **Utilize Flanks:** Take advantage of Michigan’s weakness in wide areas by deploying wingers to stretch the field, creating mismatches that can open up scoring opportunities.
